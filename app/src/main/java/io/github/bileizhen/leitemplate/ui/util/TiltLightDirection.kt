/**
 * Quantises a raw gravity vector into a stable light direction for the floating bar highlight.
 *
 * Miuix's `rememberDeviceTilt` publishes a new value for every sensor event (about 50 Hz at
 * `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME`). Feeding that stream straight into composition would invalidate the
 * floating bar on every sample, which both re-uploads the AGSL highlight uniforms continuously and
 * keeps Compose permanently non-idle. This reducer returns a value that only changes when the
 * device was actually tilted by a visible amount, so a resting device produces no recomposition at
 * all while a deliberate tilt still moves the specular light.
 *
 * The class holds no Android or Compose state and is covered by JVM unit tests.
